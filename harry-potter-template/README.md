Development Process
#1 Game Logic
I began with creating the game logic to implement the game. However, I wrote my game using
Building the Game UI
I created a workable gameboard representation which handled user actions. I struggled a bit to integrate my game logics winning combinations, but with some fiddling in Atom, I made it all work.
Implementing Authentication
I followed the Authentication template repo we worked on in class and changed some code to fit my authentication UI implementation.
Linking the Game to the Games API
I struggled a lot without linking up the game represented in the DOM where the user interacted with the game API. I wasn't positive whether or not I should use the game model provided by the API for my game UI. I went back and forth and tried a number of different solutions. This definitely slowed my process down a little bit.
