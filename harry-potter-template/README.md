Timeline: 6 days

Development Process
#1 Game Logic
I began with creating the game logic to implement the game. However, I wrote my game using the DOM instead of storing my data in the arrays. Luckily, I had allocated 2 days to create my basic game function.
#2 Building the Game UI
I created a workable gameboard representation which handled user actions.
#3 Implementing Authentication
I followed the Authentication template repo we worked on in class and changed some code to fit my authentication UI implementation. I had allocated 2 days to create this part.
#4 Linking the Game to the Games API
I struggled a lot without linking up the game files to the auth files. There was a lot of ground that we didnâ€™t cover in class that was needed to make things work. Issue queues became my best friend.
